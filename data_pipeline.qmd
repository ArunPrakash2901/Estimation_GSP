A good analysis report should be well-organised, reproducible, and simple to understand. This can be achieved by using the `targets` library, to create our workflow for nowcasting GSP(Gross state-wise product).

We load the necessary libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(targets)
```

To view and understand what our target workflow gives out, or the objects it creates, use `tar_manifest()`. This list out the objects that are going to be created and also one can get an idea of the structure and process-flow happening in the project.

```{r}
tar_manifest(script = "_targets_DataSourcing.R")
```

```{r}
Sys.setenv(R_READABS_PATH = "D:/GSP/data/temp")
tar_make(script = "_targets_DataSourcing.R")
```
